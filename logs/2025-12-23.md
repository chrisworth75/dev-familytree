# Tree Import Session - 23 December 2025

## Summary
Continued bulk importing Ancestry family trees to find evidence of Lowther (Earl of Lonsdale) connection to Wrathall family.

## Database Growth
- **Started**: 65 trees, 242,453 people, 27 Lowthers, 668 Wrathalls
- **After Batch 6**: 83 trees, 361,451 people, 279 Lowthers, 668 Wrathalls
- **Batch 7 running**: 108+ more trees being imported

## Key Finding (UPDATE: NOT A DNA MATCH)
**Tree 18571258** contains BOTH noble Lowthers AND Wrathalls, BUT the owner (Vicki Steele) is NOT a DNA match. This means it's someone else's research, not evidence of YOUR Lowther connection:

### Lowthers in tree:
- Sir Richard LOWTHER (High Sheriff of Cumberland, Lord Warden of the West Marches, Knight)
- Sir Christopher Lowther of Cumberland
- William (Sir) Lowther (b. 1612)
- Dorothy Lowther (b. 1655)
- John Lowther

### Wrathalls in same tree:
- Antonie Wraythall Wrathall
- John Wrathall (b. 1683)
- Thomas Wrathall (b. 1729)
- Stephen Wrathall (b. 1756)
- John Wrathall (b. 1792)
- James Wrathall (b. 1833)
- Nancy Jane Wrathall (b. 1864)

This suggests someone has documented a connection between the Lowther nobility and the Wrathall family!

## DNA Match Status
Still only **Joy Strong** (24.14 cM) as a DNA match with Lowthers (2) and NO Wrathalls in her tree. This remains the only independent DNA evidence of Lowther connection.

## Trees with Lowthers but No Wrathalls
Found 15 trees with Lowthers but no Wrathalls - potential independent Lowther lines:
- Tree 13492086: 92 Lowthers
- Tree 28591208: 88 Lowthers
- Tree 1938544: 32 Lowthers
- Tree 30924607: 11 Lowthers
- Plus 11 more smaller trees

## Technical Notes
- Used Ancestry API: `/api/treesui-list/trees/{TREE_ID}/persons?page=X`
- Tree ID discovery via `treeId` pattern in search results
- Search URLs: `ancestry.co.uk/search/collections/pubmembertrees/?name=Lowther&count=50`
- Many large trees (10,000-50,000 people) cause slow imports

## Next Steps
1. Finish batch 7 import (108 trees with Lowther/Cumberland/Westmorland)
2. Cross-reference new trees with DNA matches
3. Investigate tree 18571258 more closely - how are the Lowthers and Wrathalls connected?
4. Look for more trees with both families documented together

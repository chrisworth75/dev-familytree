# Session Notes - 6 January 2026

## Summary

Major focus on Cluster 17 (Henry Wrathall's unknown father line) tree imports and establishing a sustainable daily workflow.

## Achievements

### Tree Imports
- **Heather Clinch's tree imported** - 1,038 people from cluster 17 match (23 cM)
- Found connections to Dent, South Lakeland, Cumbria
- Background import job processed 106 trees but hit timeout on large tree

### Database Improvements
- Enhanced `ancestry_import.py` to update existing records with ancestry_ids and tree_ids
- Fixed script to update missing GUIDs for matches (marksutherst, Heather Clinch now have GUIDs)
- Cleared 10 wrongly-assigned tree links (matches linked to our Lowther tree instead of their own)

### Analysis
- **288 people** from Westmorland/Cumberland area now in cluster 17 trees
- **22 cluster 17 trees** fully imported
- **14 matches** still need tree IDs discovered

### Key Discovery: Bot Detection
Ancestry blocks automated access to individual match profile pages:
- Match list page (`/discoveryui-matches/list/...`) works
- Profile pages (`/discoveryui-matches/compare/...`) return "Access denied"
- Even with Chrome cookies injected, even non-headless mode is blocked
- Tree IDs are NOT in the match list HTML - must be looked up manually

## Current Cluster 17 Status

| Metric | Count |
|--------|-------|
| Total matches | 53 |
| Trees imported | 22 |
| Need tree ID | 14 |
| No tree | 17 |

### Priority Matches Needing Tree IDs (Small Trees)
| Match | cM | Tree Size |
|-------|-----|-----------|
| David Dorough | 21.0 | 11 |
| jimmant60 | 20.0 | 18 |
| linda_williamson11 | 20.0 | 19 |
| Linda Brooks Marrie | 23.0 | 33 |
| Kelly Sullivan | 22.0 | 33 |

## Sustainable Daily Workflow Established

1. **Manual (5 mins):** Look up 1-2 tree IDs on Ancestry website
2. **Automated:** Import trees with `python scripts/import_ancestry_tree.py TREE_ID`
3. **Automated:** Link tree to match in database
4. **Automated:** Run `python scripts/check_lowther_connection.py --cluster 17`

## Files Changed
- `scripts/ancestry_import.py` - Added update logic for existing records
- `README.md` - Updated with cluster 17 focus
- `logs/` directory created for daily logs
- Cleaned up superseded documentation files

## TODO for Next Session
1. Manually look up tree IDs for David Dorough, jimmant60, linda_williamson11
2. Import those small trees
3. Analyze for Westmorland/Cumberland connections
4. Continue building cluster 17 tree coverage

# Unknown Father Analysis Report
## Henry Lonsdale Wrathall (Ahnentafel Position 36)

**Generated:** 7 January 2026

---

## Executive Summary

This analysis searched for DNA matches who might connect through Henry Wrathall's unknown father. The investigation focused on:
- Distant matches (20-100 cM) who are specific to 1-2 ancestral lines
- Matches who triangulate with each other
- Excluding matches with known family surnames

**Key Finding:** No definitive "Lowther" connection was found in the DNA match trees. However, one match (Geoffrey Carr) has a person named "Lowther John Barrington" suggesting a naming connection to the Lowther family.

## Database Statistics

| Metric | Count |
|--------|-------|
| Total trees imported | 94+ (import ongoing) |
| Matches with imported trees | ~230 |
| Triangulating groups found | 14 |
| "Unknown" matches (no known surnames) | 172 |

---

## Lowther/Lonsdale Search Results

### Direct Surname Matches
- **No "Lowther" surnames found** in any DNA match trees (as actual surname)
- **"Lonsdale" appears only as middle name** in known Wrathall descendants:
  - Henry Lonsdale Wrathall
  - Constance Mary Lonsdale Wrathall
  - Sydney Henry Lonsdale Wrathall
  - Kenneth David Lonsdale Wrathall

### Potential Lowther Connection
**Geoffrey Carr (25.8 cM)** - Tree contains:
- **Lowther John Barrington** (first/middle name "Lowther")
- Multiple Barrington family members from London
- Nobility connections: Earl of Dysart, Baron Westbury

This naming pattern could indicate a connection to the Lowther family through a naming tradition rather than direct descent.

## Westmorland/Cumberland Candidates

### Matches with Westmorland connections but NO known family surnames:

| Match | cM | Key Locations | Notes |
|-------|-----|---------------|-------|
| Jill Lester | 38.0 | Great Strickland, Cumberland | Fallowfield family |
| Susan_Wilcock | 31.3 | Cumberland | Triangulates with Em Crooks |
| Lisa Carter | 29.2 | Caldbeck, Cumberland | Greenup family |
| Kenneth Olsen | 28.1 | Witon, Cumberland | Fielding family |
| **mkmanson40** | 25.9 | **Kendal, Cockermouth** | **Casson, Thursby, Lewthwaite families** |
| **Geoffrey Carr** | 25.8 | St Bees, Whitehaven | **Has "Lowther" name in tree** |
| Alice Manning | 25.7 | Euxton, Cumberland | Triangulates with Geoffrey Carr |
| Lynn Sefton | 25.0 | Clifton, Penrith | Hall family |

### Key Triangulating Pair
**Geoffrey Carr + Alice Manning** share 33 cM with each other and both have Cumberland connections:
- Common surnames: Pilkington, Whitaker, Pearce, Chapman, Wilkinson

---

## Triangulation Analysis

### Problem Identified
All 14 triangulating groups contain known family surnames (Wrathall, Saul, Tart, Heywood, etc.). This means:
1. The matches who triangulate are mostly connecting through KNOWN ancestors
2. The 172 "unknown" matches don't form strong triangulating groups with each other
3. Isolated Westmorland/Cumberland matches don't share DNA with each other

### Westmorland Matches - No Mutual Triangulation
The following matches have Westmorland connections but do NOT triangulate with each other:
- Jill Lester
- Lisa Carter
- Kenneth Olsen
- mkmanson40
- Susan_Wilcock (only triangulates with Em Crooks)

This suggests they connect through DIFFERENT ancestors, not a single unknown father line.

---

## Key Surnames to Investigate

Based on the analysis, these surnames appear in "unknown" match trees and warrant further investigation:

### From Geoffrey Carr's tree (has Lowther naming):
- Barrington (London)
- Jefferson (Cumberland - St Bees, Whitehaven)
- Vassall

### From mkmanson40's tree (extensive Kendal connections):
- **Casson** (Kendal, Westmorland)
- **Thursby** (Cockermouth, Cumberland)
- **Lewthwaite** (Cumberland)
- Bingham (Kendal)

### From triangulating pair (Geoffrey Carr + Alice Manning):
- Pilkington
- Whitaker
- Pearce

## Locations Near Lowther Estate

The Lowther family seat is Lowther Castle near Penrith. Key nearby locations found in match trees:

| Location | Distance from Lowther | Found in Trees |
|----------|----------------------|----------------|
| Penrith | ~5 miles | Lynn Sefton (Hall family) |
| Clifton | ~3 miles | Lynn Sefton |
| Great Strickland | ~8 miles | Jill Lester (Fallowfield) |
| Kendal | ~25 miles | mkmanson40 (Casson/Thursby) |
| Cockermouth | ~30 miles | mkmanson40 (Thursby) |

---

## Conclusions

1. **No direct Lowther surname found** - The Lowther family claim remains unproven by DNA tree evidence

2. **Circumstantial evidence exists:**
   - Geoffrey Carr's tree has "Lowther John Barrington"
   - Multiple matches have connections to Westmorland/Cumberland
   - The middle name "Lonsdale" in the Wrathall family is the strongest existing evidence

3. **The unknown father likely came from:**
   - Either the Lowther territory (Westmorland/Cumberland)
   - Or a completely unrelated line not yet identified

4. **Next steps recommended:**
   - Contact Geoffrey Carr about their Barrington/Lowther connection
   - Contact mkmanson40 about their Kendal/Casson connections
   - Look for DNA matches who have confirmed Lowther family connections
   - Consider Y-DNA testing to trace paternal line

## Supplemental Analysis: 8 January 2026

### Emily Hine Connection Research

**Emily Hine (134 cM)** - Expected MRCA: Arthur+Connie (Worthingtons)

Emily's tree contains 42 people, primarily:
- **Wood family** from **Beddingham, Sussex** (Richard Wood, Jane Wood, Ernest Wood)
- **Kennard family** from **Sussex** (Thomas Kennard, Fanny Kennard)
- **Hine family** from **Nottingham**

**Connection Theory:**
The Worthington line connects through the **Virgo family of Sussex**:
1. George Virgo (Chichester, Sussex) → Ethel Amelia Virgo (London)
2. Ethel Amelia Virgo married William Cheetham Goodall (Camberwell)
3. Their daughter Marjorie Goodall married Gordon Worthington (Bolton)
4. This produces Arthur Goodall Worthington (user's great-grandfather)

**hazelhersant (58 cM)** confirms the Virgo-Sussex connection with extensive Virgo ancestors from:
- Chichester, Portslade, Brighton, Cuckfield, **Ditchling** (6 miles from Beddingham)

**Finding:** Emily Hine's Wood family from Beddingham/Lewes likely connects to the Virgo family through Sussex intermarriage. Both families were in East Sussex in the 18th-19th centuries (Woods in Beddingham/Lewes, Virgos in Ditchling/Cuckfield).

**Action needed:** Trace Richard Wood of Beddingham's parents to find the Wood-Virgo connection point.

### Unknown Paternal Cluster - Lancashire Patterns

**Significant Finding:** Multiple Unknown Paternal matches have **Wood from Blackburn/Bolton**:

| Match | cM | Lancashire Connection |
|-------|-----|----------------------|
| jane_gessler | 126 | **Heywood from Farnworth/Bolton** |
| Brenda Davey | 101 | **Wood from Blackburn/Bolton** |
| Angela Ganley | 70 | Staffordshire focus |
| Ethel Hull | 52 | **Wood from Blackburn** |
| Valerie Simpson | 46 | Oldham, Lancashire |
| Joanne Harrison | 34 | Yates/Bain from Lancashire |

**Key Observation:** Henry Lonsdale Wrathall was born in **Blackburn, Lancashire**. The appearance of **Wood from Blackburn** in multiple Unknown Paternal matches is noteworthy.

**Hypothesis to investigate:** Could the unknown father have been from a Wood or Heywood family in Lancashire?

---

### Confirmed Connections

## Wood from Blackburn Investigation (9 January 2026)

### Hypothesis
Multiple Unknown Paternal matches have **Wood from Blackburn/Bolton**, and HLW was born in Blackburn. Could his father have been from a Wood family?

### Key Evidence

**Matches with Wood from Blackburn/Bolton:**

| Match | cM | Wood Individual | Location |
|-------|-----|-----------------|----------|
| Brenda Davey | 101 | Ada Bertha Wood (b. 1903), Ezra Wood, Robert Wood | Blackburn, Bolton |
| Ethel Hull | 52 | Edith Wood (b. 1910), Seth Wood, Rose Wood | Blackburn |
| geri_wood | 49 | William Wood (1797), John Peacock Wood (1818), William Leigh Wood (1843) | Didsbury, Salford |

**Triangulations within this cluster:**
- Brenda Davey + Katrina Barnes: 1612 cM (very close relatives)
- Brenda Davey + Ethel Hull: 38 cM (connected)
- Ethel Hull + Peter Ennor: 29 cM (connected)

### Bolton Wood Family (from census records)

| Name | Birth Year | Location | Occupation |
|------|------------|----------|------------|
| Joseph Wood | ~1830 | Salford | Foundry Labourer |
| Ellen Wood | ~1831 | Bolton | Cotton Piecer |
| John Wood | ~1840 | Bolton | General Labourer |
| Betsy Wood | ~1844 | Bolton | - |
| Robert Wood | ~1865 | Bolton | General Labourer |
| Albert Wood | ~1889 | Bolton | - |

**Potential father candidates (working age men in 1862-1863):**
1. **Joseph Wood** (b. ~1830) - would be 32-33 when HLW conceived
2. **John Wood** (b. ~1840) - would be 22-23 when HLW conceived

### Geographic Context

```
Susan Wrathall:  Born Settle, Yorkshire (1842)
                 ↓ (~30 miles to cotton mills)
HLW Born:        Blackburn, Lancashire (1863)
                 ↔ (~12 miles) ↔
Bolton:          Wood family concentration
```

Susan likely moved from rural Yorkshire to Lancashire cotton mills for work. Bolton and Blackburn were both major cotton manufacturing centers, only 12 miles apart.

### Main Family Tree Connection

The main family tree (193991232) contains a Bolton Wood family:
- JOHN WOOD (Bolton) - patriarch
- Children: Joseph, Thomas, Frank, Seth, Diana, Dinah, Fanny, Robert, James Wood
- Grandchildren: Frederick John (1887), Albert (1889)
- **Patricia Margaret Worthington Wood (1946)** - shows Wood-Worthington intermarriage

### Heywood Connection (Related)

**jane_gessler (126 cM)** - Unknown Paternal - has Heywood from Farnworth/Walkden (same area as Bolton Woods):
- William Heywood (Walkden)
- Sarah Ellen Heywood (Farnworth)
- Florence/Dora/Ethel Heywood (Farnworth, early 1900s)

**Both the main tree AND jane_gessler's tree have William Heywood from Walkden** - suggesting a potential common Heywood ancestor.

### Conclusions

1. **Strong geographic pattern:** Multiple Unknown Paternal matches have Wood/Heywood from Bolton/Blackburn/Farnworth - exactly where HLW was born.

2. **Two main clusters:**
   - Brenda Davey/Ethel Hull/Peter Ennor: Wood from Blackburn/Bolton
   - jane_gessler: Heywood from Farnworth/Walkden

3. **Potential father hypothesis:** A Wood or Heywood man from the Bolton/Blackburn area may have been HLW's father, rather than a Lowther from Westmorland.

4. **Next steps:**
   - Research Joseph Wood (b. ~1830) and John Wood (b. ~1840) in Blackburn records
   - Check if any Wood family members worked in Blackburn cotton mills 1860-1863
   - Look for baptism records of HLW in Blackburn to see if father is named
   - Contact Brenda Davey about their Wood family tree
